# Chatbot Project

This is a simple chatbot project that interacts with an API to generate responses based on user input.

#Installation

Clone the repository.

Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.

Ensure you have a stable internet connection.

#Setup

Add your API key and API URL in the appropriate section of the JavaScript or Java backend.

Do not expose your API key in the frontend.

Use environment variables or configuration files to store sensitive information securely.

#Usage

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Type a message in the input box and click 'Send'.

The chatbot will respond using the configured API.

#Security Best Practices

Never hardcode API keys in your code.

Use environment variables for storing sensitive data.

Implement backend authentication to restrict API access.

Hide keys in configuration files and keep them out of version control using .gitignore.

Notes

This chatbot is designed for educational purposes.

You can modify the UI and API integration as needed.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
