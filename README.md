# Java Chatbot

Java Chatbot is a desktop-based, AI-powered chatbot built using Java and Swing. It integrates secure API calls to an external AI service to generate dynamic responses based on user input. The project follows best practices for secure API key management and features a modern dark-themed UI.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  A dark-themed Swing GUI with user messages right-aligned and bot responses left-aligned.
  
- **Dynamic AI Responses:**  
  Fetch real-time responses from an external AI service via secure API integration.

- **Secure API Key Management:**  
  API keys are stored securely using environment variables or configuration files.

- **Extensible Design:**  
  The architecture allows for easy enhancements such as chat history storage via JDBC, advanced NLP, and more.
- **API :**
   Use OpenRouter for free API's and Free Chatbot / ML Models

## Technologies Used

- **Java SE** â€“ Core language for application logic.
- **Java Swing** â€“ GUI framework for building the desktop interface.
- **HTTP API Integration** â€“ Using `HttpURLConnection` for sending API requests.
- **JSON Parsing** â€“ Using the `org.json` library to process API responses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or later.
- A valid API key from your chosen AI service.
